        <p><strong>Above this paragraph</strong> is a drawing I made for a dear friend of mine about two years ago —
            it&#39;s a piece of fan art based on the 13th colossus, Phalanx, from the game Shadow of the Colossus.
            It&#39;s not my best piece, I even find some parts, like the ground, rather silly, but I like how back then
            I was more daring to try out new techniques.</p>
        <p>In 2022, I started the year with the goal to draw things that I love. This resulted in me drawing a bunch of
            portraits and guitars, which is cool, but I was ultimately just noodling around. This year I want to focus
            on big environments. Video games with &quot;lonely&quot; environments &#40;think Red Dead Redemption, The
            Last of Us, Shadow of the Colossus and Portal 2&#41; inspire me <em>a lot</em>, so painting fan art will be
            a good starting point. &#40;Next to replaying some of them ;-&#41;</p>
