            <p>“Well, Helen?” said I, putting my hand into hers: she chafed my fingers gently to warm them, and went on—

            <p>“If all the world hated you, and believed you wicked, while your own conscience approved you, and

            praising pain
            was born and I
            will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of
            the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself,
            because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter
            consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain
            pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can
            procure him some great pleasure."</p> -->

        <p><span class="capital">Welcome to my</span> little corner of the web, where I share my creations and findings
            about the arts, engineering, and other stuff. I intend to be as true to myself and my interests as possible
            — oh, how corny this might become . . .</p>

        <p>I'm hosting this website myself, with a webserver I set up in Julia, built on the <a
                href="https://genieframework.com/">Genie Framework</a>. Before I hosted a static website on <a
                href="https://neocities.org/">Neocities</a>, which was also fun, but if you're a software/system
            engineer, I'd really recommend fiddling with your a server of your own! I'm a big supporter of the
            independent web and <a href="https://jeffhuang.com/designed_to_last/">preserving your own creative
                content</a>. And next to that, this website is inspired by modern tech blogs, Dutch columnist/poetry
            websites and <a href="https://jzhao.xyz/posts/networked-thought/">digital gardens</a>.</p>

        <p>I still have to learn a lot regarding web development and creating content. I hope you'll enjoy snooping
            around, and getting a little glimspe of my journey.</p>

        <h2>my 2023 focus for art</h2>

        <div class="img-box">
            <a href="img/wander.jpg" data-lightbox="gallery" data-title="Wander and Phalanx (January 11th, 2021)">
                <img src="img/wander.jpg" alt="">
            </a>
        </div>

        <p><span class="capital">Above this paragraph</span> is a drawing I made for a dear friend of mine about two
            years ago — it's a piece of fan art based on the 13th colossus, Phalanx, from the game Shadow of the
            Colossus. It's not my best piece, I even find some parts, like the ground, rather silly, but I like how back
            then I was more daring to try out new techniques.</p>

        <p>In 2022, I started the year with the goal to draw things that I love. This resulted in me drawing a bunch of
            portraits and guitars, which is cool, but I was ultimately just noodling around. This year I want to focus
            on big environments. Video games with "lonely" environments (think Red Dead Redemption, The Last of Us,
            Shadow of the Colossus and Portal 2) inspire me <em>a lot</em>, so painting fan art will be a good starting
            point. (Next to replaying some of them ;-)</p>
